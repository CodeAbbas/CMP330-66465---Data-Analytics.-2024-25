## üìú Module Overview

[cite_start]Welcome to Data Analytics! [cite: 22] [cite_start]This module is core to computing science [cite: 24] [cite_start]and introduces the foundational concepts and best practices of data analytics and inferential statistics[cite: 54, 55]. [cite_start]Data analytics and data science practices are fundamental to data-driven and data-informed industries[cite: 23, 50].

[cite_start]The course involves a programmatic approach to exploratory data analysis, data mining, and the use of machine learning to build highly predictive models[cite: 24, 51]. [cite_start]You'll gain practical experience in writing computer programs for data analytics, data visualisation, and the development and evaluation of machine learning approaches[cite: 56, 57].
